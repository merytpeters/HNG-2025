            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hi üëãüèΩ, I'm Merit Edafe, a Full Stack Software Engineer. My journey began in public health, where a
                desire to improve healthcare outcomes sparked my interest in technology. <br> <br> That curiosity led me to learn
                web development in 2023, and since then, I've been building, and continue to build , medical web
                applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not developing APIs, I'm crafting front-end experiences and occasionally designing fun,
                engaging UIs. I love creating applications that are practical, functional, and elegantly simple,
                solutions that genuinely solve real-world problems
